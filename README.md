# Art Gallery 

## This is a webpage for entertainment, an old Gallery with information represents previous era who created ancient things and till now they got famous and still using by people.

# Motivation:
The motivation behind creating an art gallery webpage could be to showcase and promote art, provide an online platform for artists to exhibit their work, and allow art enthusiasts to explore and appreciate different artworks from various artists and styles. It can also serve as a way to support the art community by increasing the visibility and accessibility of art to a wider audience.

Problem-solving:
An art gallery webpage solves several problems, such as:

Accessibility: It allows people from different parts of the world to access and appreciate artworks without visiting a physical gallery, making art more inclusive.

Artist Exposure: It provides emerging artists with a platform to display their work and gain exposure to a global audience, 
potentially leading to more recognition and opportunities.

Learning Opportunities:
Web Development: Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and visually appealing website.

Back-End Development: Setting up server-side components for handling user data, authentication, and dynamic content generation.

Database Management: Learning to manage and organize art-related data efficiently in a database.
